# DT-Screening---Todo-List
To-Do List web application

# Good day to whom it may concern, this is my project for the DT screening which is a simple To-Do List application.

# How I tackled the task

1. I searched the web for references and for ideas on how this app works.
2. After sourcing out the reference video I watched it through and tried to understand the logic behind the project.
3. In doing that I got an idea to create based on what I have learned with the aim to be efficient in time.
4. The 2 hour time limit made it challenging giving me the choice to leverage AI in helping with the designing.
5. I used Visual Studio Code to create a mock app then with the help of AI designed the appropriate features needed.
6. I created the features one by one according to the stipulations.
7. Double checked everything before pushing a commit to Git.
8. Made systematic updates through the commit section and then finalized everything with a Quality Assurance mindset.

This is all for this project.
